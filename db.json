  "bio": "A primary focus of my life is to continually learn. My childhood of reading, violin lessons, and outdoor exploration gave me a sense of curiosity that has driven my professional growth. My career as a web developer began when a senior coworker took an extended leave of absence, leaving no one in charge of the websites and intranet. Curiosity dictated that I take the job. The challenge and on-the-job training was so addictive that I have sought it out ever since."
